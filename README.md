# javascript-object-generator
Generates an array of Javascript objects, based on user input.

## Why?
I was working on a project where I would filter a list of Javascript objects based on a set of criterias, but it was too boring to write test data by hand, and so this little tool was born.

The intended usage of this tool is to create an array of Javascript-objects that can be copypasted into another project to be used as test-data, instead of requiring the actual data before you necessarily have it. I couldn't find any tools online that did this already, so I just made it.
